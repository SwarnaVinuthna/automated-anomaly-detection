# 🔍 AI-Powered Surveillance System

An interactive **AI-based surveillance dashboard** built with **Streamlit** that demonstrates anomaly detection in video data.  
The app simulates real-time video processing, extracts behavioral features, trains an anomaly detection model, and visualizes system status, alerts, and analytics.

## 🚀 Features
- **Dashboard**: Overview of system status and recent anomaly alerts.
- **Model Training**: Train anomaly detection models using synthetic surveillance data.
- **Video Processing (Demo)**: Simulated video analysis with anomaly detection and timeline visualization.
- **Analytics & Reports**: Charts and insights on anomalies over time.
- **Settings**: Configure detection sensitivity, thresholds, and system parameters.
- **SQLite Database**: Logs detected anomalies with timestamp, camera ID, confidence, and features.
